# Re-Lending UI Guide

Please note that the term "Restake" has been renamed to "Re-Lend" in the UI.

## Re-Lending Table

The main table displays available re-lending markets (e.g., [aUSDC]USDC) with key metrics such as utilization, deposit APY, and re-lend yield. Use it to choose a market to supply.

## Re-Lend Modal

1. Select the re-lending market and input your desired amount.
2. If you supply USDC, the flow deposits to Aave to mint aUSDC, then delegates borrowing power.
3. Review the total estimated APY (Aave yield + 246 premium) and utilization impact.
4. Confirm the transaction.

## My Position

After a successful transaction, your position appears in the My Position page/table. Balances are denominated in your aToken (e.g., aUSDC). Values represent your re-lent amount, not your wallet balance.
