# Re-Lending UI Guide

Step-by-step guidance for using the re-lending interface.

1. Open the 246 Club app and navigate to Re-Lend.
2. Choose your asset (USDC or aUSDC) and amount.
3. If supplying USDC, the app will deposit it to Aave to mint aUSDC, then delegate borrowing power.
4. Review estimated APY from baseline Aave yield plus additional premium from borrowers.
5. Confirm the transaction.
6. Monitor utilization and withdrawable amounts from your position as needed.
