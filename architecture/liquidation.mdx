# Liquidation

Liquidation risk arises primarily on the borrow side (Aave) if a position’s health factor falls below threshold. 246 Club employs buffers and the `adjustDelegation` mechanism to add aToken collateral from the re-lending pool when needed.

If liquidation occurs on Aave (close factor ~50%), debt is partially repaid and collateral is reduced. Repayments on 246 Club cover remaining Aave debt, while penalties are absorbed by added interest or reserves.
