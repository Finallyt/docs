# Interest Rate Model

246 Club’s interest rate model adds a premium on top of Aave’s borrow rates to capture cross-protocol opportunities (e.g., Morpho deposit yield vs Aave borrow rate). The premium converges total borrow costs toward external deposit yields when arbitrage is present, sharing upside with re-lenders.

Key goals:

- Incentivize balanced utilization in re-lending pools
- Capture external yield differentials as additional borrower premium
- Return incremental yield to re-lenders
