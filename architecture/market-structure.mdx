# Market Structure

246 Club aggregates lending and borrowing across protocols by separating where collateral earns yield and where debt is sourced. Re-lenders delegate borrowing power from aTokens, while borrowers post collateral elsewhere (e.g., Morpho) and draw debt (e.g., on Aave).

## Components

- Re-lending pools backed by aTokens (e.g., aUSDC)
- Delegated borrowing power routed to borrower positions
- Cross-protocol settlement that ensures debts are covered by external collateral

## Flow overview

1. Lenders deposit or provide aTokens, delegating borrowing power to the pool.
2. Borrowers post collateral in a supported protocol and borrow from Aave against that collateral.
3. Interest-rate differentials are captured, sharing premium with re-lenders.
