# Segmented Risk Exposure

Risk is segmented across markets and protocols. Re-lenders are primarily exposed to the underlying Aave market’s health for the aToken they supply (e.g., aUSDC), while borrowers are exposed to collateral protocol risk (e.g., Morpho) and borrow-side risk (Aave rates, liquidation).

Segmentation enables targeted controls and buffers per market, isolating incidents and reducing systemic contagion.
