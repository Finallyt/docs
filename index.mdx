# Overview

246 Club aims to enable users to access the best elements of every lending protocol within a single platformâ€”a unified layer where existing money legos are assembled. By harnessing the strengths of various protocols, we aim to create a powerful aggregated system that surpasses the capabilities of individual components.

## Thesis

1. The lending market is horizontally expanding as tokenized yields and asset classes with varied risk-return profiles multiply.

2. Lending protocols now serve as base-layer infrastructures, each tailored to granular needs and localized markets. Expect further growth as new yield-bearing assets emerge and DeFi widens.

3. Localized markets exhibit distinct supply-demand dynamics shaped by collateral-borrow pairs, risk models, or transient market conditions, creating a patchwork of [specialized local equilibria](https://x.com/246_club/status/1881001684534804577).

4. Interest-rate arbitrage shines in the form of [atomic cross-protocol](https://x.com/Glovin_/status/1881735272125382697) loans, where collateral is locked in high-demand markets and borrowed from low-demand ones for maximum efficiency.

## Key Features

### Lending Restaking

Earn additional yields on your existing lending positions on Aave (by capturing fragmented values across different lending markets.) (by delegating borrowing power to capture fragmented values across different lending markets)

### Cross Protocol Loan Position

Deposit collateral to high yielding positions to borrow from lending protocols with the best interest rates to optimize loan costs or leverage arbitrage opportunities. e.g. Deposit collateral to Morpho(high yield) and borrow from Aave(interest rate stability)

Furthermore, if you're lending on protocols that don't allow native rehypothecation (can't borrow against your lending position) such as Morpho, you can use 246 to borrow from Aave against or leverage your existing deposit positions to maximize yield or access capital from your current holdings.
