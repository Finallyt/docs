# Re-Lending UI Guide

Please note that the term "Restake" has been updated to "Re-Lend." All references to "Restake" in the UI guide have been replaced with "Re-Lend" in the official user interface.

As outlined in the [Market Structure section](architecture/market-structure), each market on 246Club consists:

- • Re-Lending Asset: The asset that re-lenders supply (typically aTokens).
- • Delegation Asset: The borrowing power derived from re-lenders' collateral, used by borrowers to access capital.

Since the re-lending asset is what users directly interact with on the interface, this guide will focus on that side of the UI.

## Re-Lending Table

### Re-Lending Asset Column

The leftmost column in the UI displays all supported re-lending assets—typically Aave's aTokens like aUSDC, aDAI, etc.

However, users without existing aToken holdings can also choose to supply the underlying asset (e.g., USDC). Next to each aToken, you'll also see its underlying asset (e.g., USDC for aUSDC, ETH or WETH for aWETH).

In that case, the protocol will:

1. Deposit the underlying into Aave.
2. Receive the corresponding aToken.
3. Automatically re-lend the aToken into 246Club.

> Note on ETH: Both ETH and WETH are supported as re-lending options, since Aave and 246 treat them equivalently when minting aWETH.

Whether you deposit an aToken or its underlying asset, the result is the same—you end up with a re-lent position in the 246 Club market. This feature simply provides flexibility for users without existing Aave positions.

### Balance Column

Balance column shows the total amount of assets available in your wallet for re-lending.

When you hover over the balance number, you'll see a breakdown of:

- • The amount of the aToken (e.g., aUSDC) you hold.
- • The amount of the underlying asset (e.g., USDC) you hold.
- • The combined total of both.

### APY Column

APY column displays the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) you'll earn by re-lending.

Hovering over the APY column reveals a breakdown of:

- • Underlying APY: The base interest rate you earn from supplying the aToken on Aave (e.g., the supply rate for aUSDC). This is a guaranteed return.
- • Re-Lend APY: The additional yield you earn by re-lending your aToken and delegating its borrowing power in the 246 Club market.
- • Combined APY: The total of the two rates.

The combined APY helps you estimate the full return on re-lending.

## Re-Lend Modal

Clicking the supply button opens a modal where you can configure how much you want to re-lend. There are three sections: one for re-lending aTokens and another for underlying assets and the summary section.

### 1. Aave Position Section

At the top, you'll see a box with the Aave logo. This shows your current aToken balance and borrowing status on Aave tied to the aToken you've selected (e.g., aUSDC or aWETH).

If you already have a loan on Aave, your aTokens are likely being used as collateral. In that case, withdrawing and re-lending too much could impact your health factor.

We show:

- • Current collateral and borrow value
- • Estimated LTV after re-lending
- • A visual indicator of the safe threshold

Make sure you stay above the safety threshold to avoid liquidation.

### 2. Underlying Asset Section

Below the Aave box is where you can re-lend underlying assets.

- • You can input any amount within your wallet balance.
- • For ETH-based assets, WETH is used by default. You can also enable native ETH by checking the "Allow ETH" option.

You can use either or both fields—re-lending will combine the amounts.

### 3. Summary Section

Once you've entered your desired inputs, you'll see the Total Re-Lent Amount reflected. Confirm the transaction to complete re-lending.

## My Position

After a successful transaction, you'll be redirected to the My Position page.

Even if you've re-lent the underlying asset, your re-lending balance will be shown denominated in your aToken balance.

This table is similar to the original re-lending table, with one key difference:

• Balances here reflect your re-lent amount, not what remains in your wallet.
