# Managing Loan Position

Once a cross-protocol loan is established, it must be maintained to ensure a healthy loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

## Key actions

- Repay a portion of the borrowed asset to reduce LTV
- Add collateral to improve the health factor
- Monitor rates and adjust as markets change

## Health factor

The health factor reflects how close your position is to liquidation. Keep it safely above the threshold by adjusting collateral or debt.
