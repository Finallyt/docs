# Cross-Protocol Loan UI Guide

## Borrow Flow

1. Navigate to Borrow.
2. Choose your collateral source (e.g., Morpho Earn Vault) and borrow asset (e.g., USDC on Aave).
3. If you don’t have a Morpho position, use “zap” to deposit and create collateral in one step.
4. Review estimated health factor, LTV, rates, and fees.
5. Confirm to open the position.

## Manage

- Repay debt or add collateral to improve health factor.
- Monitor utilization and rates to optimize costs.
