# Considerations for Re-Lending

## Risk of Aave

At 246 Club, we build our Re-Lending on Aave, a leading DeFi lending protocol with a strong history of security and resilience across multiple blockchain networks. While Aave’s proven track record gives us a solid foundation, our Re-Lending mechanism—using Aave positions like aUSDC as underlying assets—introduces specific risks. Here’s how we manage Aave-related risks to keep our markets stable.

Our primary exposure comes from the lending positions on Aave, such as aUSDC, that re-lenders use in markets like [aUSDC]USDC. If bad debt (unrepayable loans) occurs in the aUSDC pool, it could affect your re-lend position. For example, if you re-lend 100 aUSDC, bad debt on Aave might impact the stability of that position in our market.

However, with Aave’s Optimistic Accounting, Aave delays the impact of bad debt on aTokens like aUSDC. If bad debt occurs, your 100 aUSDC won’t lose value immediately, giving us time to address the issue.

Also, Aave’s Umbrella feature will prevent small bad debt from accumulating and absorb any residual debt, further protecting your re-lend position.

For a deeper understanding, check Aave’s risk documentation on market volatility, smart contracts, and liquidations.

## Liquidity Risk

In Re-Lending, liquidity risk arises when the demand for borrowing exceeds the available borrowing power, potentially limiting withdrawals from the pool. We manage this risk by monitoring utilization and using mechanisms to balance supply and demand.

**Utilization Ratio in Re-Lending Market**

The utilization ratio in a Re-Lending market tells us how much of the delegated borrowing power is being used:

`Utilization Ratio = Borrowing Power Used / Total Delegated Borrowing Power`

Example with the [aUSDC]USDC market: delegate 80 USDC borrowing power, 72 USDC used → 90% utilization. The underutilized portion (10%) determines withdrawable amount: 100 aUSDC × 10% = 10 aUSDC.

High utilization reduces immediate withdrawable amounts; rate curves incentivize rebalancing via higher borrow rates and better re-lender yields.

## Collateral Risk and Liquidation Mechanics (Aave Position)

In re-lending, an Aave position (backed by your aTokens) and a 246 Club position (backed by borrower collateral) coexist.

To mitigate liquidation risk on Aave:

1. Match re-lending and delegation assets (e.g., aUSDC → USDC) to avoid price basis risk.
2. Leverage Aave’s optimistic accounting and features to buffer small bad debt.
3. Account for net negative APY from borrow vs deposit spread; long-term drift is slow given buffers.
4. Maintain buffers (e.g., over-allocating aToken collateral) informed by historical deviations and net APY trends.
5. Use `adjustDelegation` to add aToken collateral from the re-lending pool if health falls below threshold; supported by automation and manual backstops.

Extreme liquidation requires rapid rate spikes and failures of automated/manual safeguards, or major depegs.

If liquidation occurs on Aave (50% close factor), the remaining debt is covered by repayments on 246 Club; penalties are absorbed by additional interest or reserves.

## Re-Lending for existing Borrowers of Aave

If you’re currently borrowing on Aave, you can re-lend a portion of your aTokens while keeping your loan safe. For example, if you re-lend 20 aUSDT out of 100 aUSDT, you’ll have 80 aUSDT left backing your 20 DAI loan. Your Loan-to-Value (LTV) adjusts from 20% to 25% (20/80). Re-lend as much as feels comfortable for your risk preferences.

## Risk Specific to Credit Delegation

### 1) The Dual-Position Structure in Re-Lending

When a borrower opens a loan via 246 Club, two positions exist:

1. Aave Position (re-lender): 100 aUSDC collateral; 80 USDC debt via delegation (LTV 80%).
2. 246 Club Position (borrower): 100 USDC collateral (e.g., on Morpho); 80 USDC borrowed using delegated power.

These are interconnected but governed by different risk parameters.

### 2) Risk Management for the Aave Position

1. Matching re-lending and delegation assets (e.g., aUSDC → USDC) removes price basis risk.
2. Leverage Aave’s optimistic accounting and Umbrella (to absorb small residual debt).
3. Handle interest accumulation: borrow APY > deposit APY implies slow net negative drift; buffers delay liquidation timelines.
4. Buffer against volatility: allocate extra aToken collateral (e.g., 110 aUSDC backing 80 USDC debt).
5. Public `adjustDelegation`: if health falls below threshold, anyone can add aToken collateral from the re-lending pool. Backed by bots and manual intervention.

### 3) Extreme Scenarios for Liquidation

Liquidation on Aave would require rapid rate spikes with simultaneous automation failures, or a major, fast depegging that overwhelms buffers.

### 4) What Happens If Liquidation Occurs?

With Aave’s ~50% close factor, half the debt is repaid and collateral is reduced. The remaining Aave debt is covered by repayments on 246 Club. Liquidation penalties are absorbed by incremental interest earned or a dedicated reserve (to be introduced).
